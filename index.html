<h3><strong>You can always count on me when...</strong></h3>
<p>You are looking for those pro-coding-tips so I we can look for them together <br> because my answer will probably be: I have no idea.

I am also not much of an organizer but I rarely am in a bad mood! <br>
Thinking out side the box is a thing I feel good at but this feels like boasting so lets just see...

<br>I try to be myself and I hope that positivly reflects on other peoples comfort. Life is to short to waste it on embarrassment or prejudice or ...
<br>I live rather close to campus in a cosy co-housing so if that can be of any service, let me know! I was active (pre-corona) on <a href="www.couchsurfing.com"> couchsurfing </a> 
so I really don't mind.

<h4><strong>A funny story</strong></h4>
<p>I used to be in a youth movement (<a href="www.jnm.be">jnm</a>)
    and every summer we all went to "the Ardennen". You know, campfires, games in the woods, some good vegetarian food, hella fun! 

One day we competed in a row of games against a french neighbouring group of Scouts we had met the other day.
Needless to say we won, but maybe not as good winners. 
That night they stole our flag as revenge, a common prank. 
Ofcourse  we felt obliged to steal theirs aswell.
All went smooth as a whistle. In and out, 20 minute adventure..
A few mornings laters everyone awoke to a loud roar, could have been a Yeti, but it was none else than our campleader who woke up to the trembling sight of his car with a human poop on his roof.
In a frenzy, he gathered me and some other board members and we drove to the neighbouring camp to complain (they had also left some dents in the car). The funny part is that slowly, very slowly, the poop started falling down on his windshield. And in a reflex he put on his wipers... To top it off, once we arrived he started talking in the most broken french, pointing at his pooped windshield. A time to remember!!
</p>
<br> 
<h4><strong> TL;DR</strong></h4> <p>Some scouts pooped on the campsmasters window, we drove over to them but the poop got smeared all over the window!</p>
